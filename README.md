##A UI problem statement solution solved by me

##PROBLEM STATEMENT - 
######Make an app which allow students to bookmark their important questions from subjects like Physics, Chemistry and more,
######which they can follow up easily at the time of their exams.

##SOLUTION -

This is the home page of the app which shows the subjects. Below this the recent marked questions are shown.
You can add a New Book or New Bookmark by tapping the add button in the bottom right corner.

Next, on tapping any book the Bookmarked questions of that subject are visible.
You can tap on any question to take a quick view or tap View Answer Button to view the full answer.

Now, adding a bookmark, choose class and subject and then enter your question and answer.
You can add different tags to make the things easy - like if you are not getting a question at once you can put a tag ( DO IT AGAIN ) on it for future reference.
You can also add images from you hard copy books as you feel sluggish sometimeüò™.
